# Wordle Solver
### Brief
I create a solver for pop game WORDLE. With this program, you can:
1. Just give it a hint each round when it guesses a word, and you'll be able to solve puzzles quickly.
1. Extend the corpus from your word list file.

### Usage
Enter the folder where `main.py` is located, and

* run the solver directly with

    ```python main.py```

* extend the corpus and run the solver with

    ```python main.py [-u <path>][--update <path>]```
